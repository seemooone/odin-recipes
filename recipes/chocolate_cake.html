    <h3>Delicious and Soft Chocolate Cake With Chocolate Frosting</h3>
    <p>
      This recipe was forged in the fires of Hel when the Great Odin was struck by a lust for even
      chocolatier chocolatey goodness. Pretty simple and easy to make it's awesome actually.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 3/4 cups all purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 cups granulated white sugar</li>
      <li>3/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>
        1 cup buttermilk or substitute by putting 1 tablespoon white vinegar/lemon juice in a cup
        then filling the rest up with milk; let stand for 5 minutes until thickened
      </li>
      <li>1/2 cup melted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup hot coffee or 2 teaspoon instant coffee in 1 cup boiling water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and flour two 9-inch circular baking pans.</li>
      <li>
        In the large bowl of a standing mixer, stir together flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking
        soda, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add eggs, buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla extract and beat until smooth (about 3
        minutes)
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove bowl from mixer and stir in hot coffee with a rubber spatula. Batter will be very
        runny.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour batter evenly between the two pans and bake on middle rack of oven for about 35
        minutes, or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean with just a few moist crumbs
        attached.
      </li>
      <li>
        Allow to cool for 15 minutes in pans, then run a butter knife around the edges of each cake.
        Place a wire cooling rack over top of each pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        While wearing oven mitts, use both hands to hold the racks in place while flipping the cakes
        over.
      </li>
      <li>
        Set the racks down and gently thump on the bottom of the pans until the cakes release. Cool
        completely before handling or frosting.
      </li>
    </ol>
