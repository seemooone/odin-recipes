    <h3>Delicious and Creamy Chicken With Loads of Garlic</h3>
    <p>
      This recipe was forged in the fires of Hel when the Great Odin was struck by a lust for creamy
      goodness. Really simple and easy to make it's pretty awesome actually.

      <li>4 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For The Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>5 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>2 tablepoons butter</li>
      <li>1 small onion finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 whole head of garlic peeled and divided into 10-12 cloves</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cup of chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 1/4 half and half or heavy cream</li>
      <li>1/2 cup finely grated fresh Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Season the chicken with salt, garlic powder and pepper.</li>
      <li>
        In a shallow bowl, combine the flour, parmesan cheese. Dredge chicken in the flour mixture;
        shake off excess.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 tablespoons of oil and 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
        Swirl pan to coat evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fry 2-3 chicken breasts until golden on each side, cooked through and no longer pink (about
        4-5 minutes each side, depending on the thickness of your chicken). Transfer to a warm
        plate. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Wipe pan over with a sheet of paper towel. Repeat with remaining oil, butter and chicken
        breasts. When cooked, transfer the chicken onto the same plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium. Sauté the onion in the remaining oil/juices in the pan until
        softened.
      </li>
      <li>Smash 6 whole cloves of garlic with the blunt edge of the back of a knife</li>
      <li>
        Add the remaining oil to the pan and heat through, mixing it through the onions. Sauté
        smashed garlic cloves and whole garlic cloves until fragrant, about 2-3 minutes. Add the
        broth to deglaze the pan. Scrape up any browned bits and let simmer and reduce to half,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce heat to medium-low. Pour in the cream. Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer for about
        2-3 minutes, combining all of the flavours together.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix in the parmesan cheese. Continue cooking gently for about 2-3 minutes until cheese
        melts, while stirring occasionally. Season with salt and pepper to your taste.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the chicken back into the pan and let simmer for a further 2-3 minutes to thicken the
        sauce to your liking. The chicken breast will soak up all of the delicious flavours.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with parsley and a little black cracked pepper.</li>
    </ol>
